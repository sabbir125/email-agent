# AI Email Agent

An AI-powered email monitoring agent that reads emails, classifies them using OpenAI, and displays a live dashboard. Supports both a mock JSON source (for testing) and Gmail via IMAP.

---

## Features

- Reads emails from Gmail (IMAP) or a local mock JSON file
- Classifies emails with OpenAI into categories: `PAYMENT_ISSUE`, `SERVER_DOWN`, `CUSTOMER_COMPLAINT`, `ACCOUNT_ACCESS`, `GENERAL_SUPPORT`, `NEWSLETTER`, `SPAM`
- Assigns a priority (`HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, `LOW`) and importance flag
- Persists results to **PostgreSQL** (local Docker or Neon cloud)
- Live dashboard at `/` with real-time polling, filter tabs, and toast notifications
- REST API endpoints for emails and stats
- Background scheduler that polls for new emails on a configurable interval
- Serverless-aware: skips the background scheduler when `VERCEL=1` is set

## Setup

### 1. Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# ─── Database ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Local Docker:  postgresql+psycopg2://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/emailagent
# Neon (cloud):  postgresql+psycopg2://user:pass@ep-xxx.region.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg2://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/emailagent

SCHEDULER_INTERVAL_MINUTES=2
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4.1-mini
OPENAI_TIMEOUT=30

# ─── Email Source ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# "mock" reads from mock_data/emails.json
# "gmail" connects via IMAP
EMAIL_SOURCE=mock

MOCK_DATA_PATH=mock_data/emails.json

# ─── Gmail IMAP (required when EMAIL_SOURCE=gmail) ───────────────────────────
GMAIL_USER=you@gmail.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx
GMAIL_MAX_EMAILS=20
GMAIL_FOLDER=INBOX
```

> For Gmail, enable IMAP and generate an [App Password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833).

### 2. Run with Docker (recommended)

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This starts two containers:
- `email-agent-db` — PostgreSQL 16, data persisted in the `email_db_data` volume
- `ai-email-agent` — the FastAPI app, available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

The app container waits for the database health check to pass before starting.

### 3. Run locally

You need a running PostgreSQL instance. The quickest way is to start just the database container:

```bash
docker compose up db -d
```

Then install dependencies and start the app:

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate       # Windows
# source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux

pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Make sure `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env` points to your local Postgres instance. Tables are created automatically on first startup via `init_db()`.

### 4. Using Neon (serverless Postgres)

Create a free database at [neon.tech](https://neon.tech) and set `DATABASE_URL` to your Neon connection string:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg2://user:pass@ep-xxx.region.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require
```

## AI Classification Logic

Email classification is handled in `app/services/classifier.py` using the OpenAI Chat Completions API.

### How it works

1. **Prompt construction** — The classifier builds a user prompt containing the sender address, subject, and body. A fixed system prompt instructs the model to respond with a strict JSON object and nothing else.

2. **Model call** — The request is sent to the configured model (default: `gpt-4.1-mini`) with `temperature=0.1` to keep outputs deterministic, and `max_tokens=256` since the response is small and structured.

3. **Response parsing** — The raw response is stripped of any accidental markdown fencing (` ``` `) before being parsed as JSON and validated against the `ClassificationResult` Pydantic schema.

4. **Failure handling** — Any `JSONDecodeError`, `OpenAIError`, or unexpected exception returns `None`. The scheduler logs the failure and skips persisting that email, so a single bad response never blocks the rest of the batch.

### Output schema

```json
{
  "important": true,
  "priority": "HIGH",
  "category": "SERVER_DOWN",
  "confidence": 94,
  "reason": "Email reports a production outage affecting all users."
}
```

### Classification categories

| Category | Description |
|---|---|
| `PAYMENT_ISSUE` | Payment failures or billing problems |
| `SERVER_DOWN` | Infrastructure or outage alerts |
| `CUSTOMER_COMPLAINT` | Customer dissatisfaction |
| `ACCOUNT_ACCESS` | Login issues or security alerts |
| `GENERAL_SUPPORT` | General support requests |
| `NEWSLETTER` | Marketing and newsletters |
| `SPAM` | Spam or irrelevant emails |

### Priority and importance rules

The model determines both `priority` and `important` independently based on content. In practice:
- `SERVER_DOWN` and `PAYMENT_ISSUE` typically resolve to `HIGH` priority and `important: true`
- `NEWSLETTER` and `SPAM` typically resolve to `LOW` priority and `important: false`
- The `confidence` field (0–100) reflects the model's self-reported certainty

---

## Dashboard

The dashboard is served at `http://localhost:8000/` and rendered server-side via Jinja2 on first load. After that, the page updates itself every **30 seconds** by polling the REST API — no page reload required.

### Stats bar

Three cards at the top show live counts: **Total Processed**, **Important**, and **Ignored**. These update on every poll cycle.

### Filter tabs

- **Important** (default) — shows only emails where `important = true`, ordered by received date descending
- **All Emails** — shows the full inbox regardless of importance flag

### Email cards

Each card displays:
- Priority badge (colour-coded: red = HIGH, amber = MEDIUM, green = LOW)
- Category tag
- Subject and sender
- AI-generated reason for the classification
- Received timestamp and confidence percentage
- A pulsing **NEW** badge for emails that arrived after the page was loaded

### Toast notifications

When the poller detects an email that wasn't present on the previous fetch, a slide-in toast appears in the bottom-right corner for 5 seconds. This fires only for important emails, regardless of which filter tab is active.

### Bell badge

The notification bell in the header tracks unread important email count. The count persists across page reloads via `localStorage` and is cleared by clicking the bell.

## Limitations

**AI classification accuracy**
- The model classifies based on subject and body text only. Emails with vague subjects and minimal bodies may be miscategorised or receive low confidence scores.
- `gpt-4.1-mini` is fast and cheap but less capable than larger models. Edge cases (e.g. multi-topic emails, non-English content) may not classify correctly.
- The `important` flag and `priority` are fully determined by the model. There is no rule-based fallback, so prompt injection in email bodies could potentially influence results.

**Gmail / IMAP**
- Only the `n` most recent emails per folder are fetched each poll cycle (`GMAIL_MAX_EMAILS`). Older emails that arrive out of order may be missed.
- The persistent IMAP connection can drop silently on long idle periods. The reader reconnects automatically on the next poll, but one poll cycle may be skipped.
- Gmail App Passwords require 2-Step Verification to be enabled on the account.
- OAuth2 is not supported — only App Password authentication.

**Deduplication**
- Emails are deduplicated by `Message-ID` header. If a mail server sends the same email with different Message-IDs (e.g. forwarding rules or server-side redelivery), duplicates will be stored.
- Mock mode re-reads the same JSON file on every poll. Emails already in the database are skipped by the duplicate check, but adding new entries to `emails.json` while the app is running will cause them to be picked up on the next cycle.

**Scalability**
- The scheduler runs in-process using APScheduler. Under heavy load or with large mailboxes, the classification loop (one OpenAI call per new email) will slow down proportionally to the number of unprocessed emails.
- There is no rate-limit handling for the OpenAI API. Hitting token or request-per-minute limits will cause individual emails to fail classification silently.
- PostgreSQL is the only supported database. SQLite is not tested.

**Dashboard**
- The dashboard polls every 30 seconds. There is no WebSocket or server-sent event push, so notifications can lag up to 30 seconds behind real-time.
- The bell badge unread count is stored in `localStorage` per browser. It is not synced across devices or browser profiles.
- No authentication or access control is implemented. Anyone with network access to port 8000 can view all emails and stats.

**Deployment**
- Running on Vercel (or any platform that sets `VERCEL=1`) disables the background scheduler. Email processing will only happen on the initial startup request, not on a recurring schedule.
- The Docker image runs as root by default. For production deployments, add a non-root user to the Dockerfile.
